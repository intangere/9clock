Found a patch in old google archives for the plan9 clock to run on linux.<br>
Just took the plan9 mkfile and it compiled fine.<br>
Compile it like this

```
mk all
```

Result should be 9clock.o <br>
Rename it to 9clock or something. <br>
You can move it to your /bin folder or wherever to make a system command
